# Dear All Venticord Users
This mod has been discontinued and should NOT be installed or updated from now on.
To clarify, this IS ran by one prson and faced this for a long time.

I am, however, making plugins for Vencord itself on my main account... so YES do check it out!

[Check it out here](https://github.com/josiauh/Vencord)

If you HAVE used Venticord in the last few years (that it was supported) and updated it WON'T work anymore (bricked)
